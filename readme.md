> An implementation of fundamental group theory algorithms in Rust


This repository aims to implement highly efficient backtrack search algorithms in permutation groups. These will solve a range of problems, including (but not limited to)

* Group intersection
* Normalizer
* Centralizer
* Graph Isomorphism
* Coset intersection
* Canonical images

This is based on the theory in the paper [Permutation group algorithms based on directed graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04783), which extends the classic Partition Backtrack framework of Jeffrey Leon.
