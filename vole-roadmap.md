Roadmap for vole
================

Vole is intended to be a replacement for ferret, implementing GraphBacktracking


Core
======

* Backtracking partition 🎉
* Store graphs on original set of vertices 🎉
* Trace store / check 🎉
* Backtracking partition -- add vertices 🎉
* Graph -- add vertices 🎉
* "Full" refiner (go and run a full search at a node of search) (TODO)


Refiners
========

* Add refiners for set/tuple stabiliser 🎉
* Refiner for digraph 🎉
* Refiner for SetSet 🎉
* Refiner for SetTuple 🎉 
* Refiner from GAP 🎉
    * Only call when it will update 🎉
    * Run as incrementally as possible (TODO)
* Refiner for perm conjugacy (TODO)
* Refiner for basic normaliser 🎉
  * Refiner for "better normaliser" (TODO)
* Refiner for basic conjugacy (TODO)
  * Refiner for "better conjugacy (TODO)
  
Search types
============

* Perform search finding all solutions 🎉
* Perform search finding only generators 🎉
* Coset search for single element 🎉
* Coset search for single element + generators (OPTIONAL)
* Canonical image 🎉

Support
=======
* GAP package 🎉
* Documentation
* Testing 🎉
* Website
* Benchmarks
